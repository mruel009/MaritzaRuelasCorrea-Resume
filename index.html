        <div class="subheading mb-5">LinguisticsðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a second year student at the University of California, Riverside. My major is Linguistics and a minor in either Japanese or Education. Still undecided between both minors but I might end up doing both or just Japanese. Besides learning Japanese I am fluent in both Spanish and English. With the major and minor I hope to work in teaching or therapy for people that also have issues with speaking. I am currently unemployed because of the current time we are living in. I am at home taking care of my younger sisters and helping them out in their school work. I really enjoy helping my siblings since it is a test for me to develop my skills that are hard to maintain now since quarantine. I have skills that revolve around my education and small work with family.<br><br>

        I have been focusing on my education that I lack a little in work experience. I can say that my weakness is work experience. Although, my skills that I developed through involvement with others and activities are my strengths. I have developed my skill since high school and my two years in college. In college, I worked with children and their teachers in order to understand how children learn. I developed the skill to understand children and listening. Children tend to be talkative but it helped me listen to others to build a trust system. In college, I used the skills learned in high school to transition because it was difficult to talk to others and get used to the environment. I have been working on being patient with people and children since I have experience of waiting and taking care of people. I have also worked on improving my communication skills since I have a problem stuttering when I get nervous. I have the tendency to speak fast and flumble on my words, which makes it difficult to speak with others. To fix my stutter I try to go over my thoughts before I say anything to others. I am not shy around most people, I just feel that my stutter gets a bit awkward to talk with others.<br><br>

        Overall, I am a patient person with others and especially with myself. Through my experiences from grad school and college, I am able to learn more about others and myself. These experiences and my lack of work experiences help me find motivation that I need to learn and work with others. I am hoping with this hardship we are facing I can develop more skills that need to grow more. I hope that with my learning that I can help others learn and develop their own skills. I am wanting to learn more about myself in the university because I just noticed my stutter issue. It wasn't a problem until recently but I will overcome it. So come in and see my resume. I hope to work with you soon. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to show myself.
